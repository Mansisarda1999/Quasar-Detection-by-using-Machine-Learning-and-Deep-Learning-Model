# Quasar-Detection-by-using-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-Model
## ML Formulation : 
To identify an astronomical object whether it is a Quasar, Galaxy or Star. Thus, the ml problem here is to train a Multi Class classification model. 
Quasar is an extremely rare class of object and of utmost scientific importance. Thus, the main focus will be to build a machine learning model 
that reduces the error of classifying a Quasar as Non Quasar object that is a model with reduced FNR for Quasar objects.
To study all the features provided by the different data releases of Sloan Digital Sky Survey useful for classifying Quasar.
